# Contributing to NebulaFS

## Workflow
- Use feature branches and open PRs.
- Use Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, refactor:, test:, perf:, ci:, build:, revert:).
- Run `cmake --preset debug` and tests before submitting.

## Code Style
- C++20, RAII, no raw owning pointers.
- Doxygen-style docs for public methods.
- Commenting guidelines: `docs/code-style.md`.
